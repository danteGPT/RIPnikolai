Using game theory and cryptography, we can make peer-to-peer protocols which act as corruption-resistant alternatives to financial institutions.

Current Projects
fir - concatenative binary IR; metered VM with first-class virtualization; zero-overhead nested rollups
rico - fork of dai with original design for rate controller and reference price calculator
dmap - ultraminimalist take on immutable registries, no root keys or backdoors for your software supply chain
dpack - EVM address+artifact lockfile spec and tool, use with dmap to de-root your defi dapp
feedbase - bust open EVM oracle network silos by making composability a competitive factor
manaflow - smart contract VM with parallel validation of a stateful and composable programming model, an alternative to sharding
minicash - big-block UTXO coin with fraud proofs and tiny spec, POC for manaflow scaling
